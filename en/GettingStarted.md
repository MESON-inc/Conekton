# Getting Started

Conekton has two main features.

The one is Utility feature sets for cross-platform functions; the other is Multiplayer feature sets for multiuser functions.

If you don't need the multiuser functionality to your app, you can use Utility feature sets alone. However, if you want to add the Multiplayer functionality to your app, you have to use both, because the multiuser functionality depends on the Utility functionality.
